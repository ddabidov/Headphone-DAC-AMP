# Headphone DAC/AMP Overview

## Abstract

## 1. Introduction

###  1.1 Background & Motivation
High-fidelity audio has become increasingly difficult to access for the average user, as most integrated digital-to-analog 
converters (DACs) in phones and laptops are limited to 16-bit resolution and a 44.1 kHz sampling rate, which is 
only marginally sufficient for modern high-resolution audio standards. At the other end of the spectrum, systems 
capable of 24-bit resolution and sampling rates above 98 kHz are often prohibitively expensive and rely on external
power sources, making them bulky and inconvenient for portable use or integration into an already crowded home audio 
setup. <br> <br>

The goal of this project is to demonstrate that both high resolution and high sampling rates can be achieved in a 
compact, affordable system, designed and built by amateur, recently graduated engineers. While a moderate amount of 
theoretical information explaining how a DAC-amplifier system functions is available online, practical guidance 
regarding component selection, layout considerations, IC integration, and signal-path design remains limited. This 
project therefore also aims to serve as a technical resource for future designers interested in high-fidelity audio 
systems, reducing the barrier to entry and simplifying the development process. 

###  1.2 Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to design, implement, and test a compact, high-fidelity DAC-amplifier that is 
cost-effective relative to comparable commercial products. The system will convert digital audio data into a 
clean, low-noise analog output and will support a wide range of headphones and earbuds with impedances between 
10 Ω and 300 Ω. All operation will be powered exclusively through a USB-C 2.0 interface, eliminating the need for 
any external power supply, and output to a 3.5mm balanced jack. <br> <br>
